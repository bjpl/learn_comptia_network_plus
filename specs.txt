## Complete Interactive Web Component Specifications for CompTIA Network+ N10-009

### **Learning Objective 1.0: EXPLAIN concepts related to the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model**

#### **Component 1: Layer Explanation Builder**
*Directly practices the "explain" verb for all seven OSI layers*

Each accordion header shows the layer number, name, and a completion status indicator (empty circle, half-filled, or checkmark).

When expanded, each layer section contains four interactive zones:
1. **Primary Function Selector**: A dropdown menu with 5-7 function options specific to that layer (e.g., for Transport: "Reliable delivery and error recovery", "Physical addressing", "Routing and logical addressing", "Session management", "Data formatting")
2. **Protocol Checkbox Grid**: A 4x5 grid of protocol checkboxes including correct and incorrect options. Students must identify 2-3 correct protocols per layer from options like TCP, UDP, IP, Ethernet, HTTP, FTP, etc.
3. **Data Unit Input Field**: A text input for entering the correct PDU name (bits for Layer 1, frames for Layer 2, packets for Layer 3, segments for Layer 4, data for Layers 5-7)
4. **Layer Interaction Text Area**: A 150-word minimum text area where students explain how this layer interacts with adjacent layers, with real-time word counter and quality indicators
