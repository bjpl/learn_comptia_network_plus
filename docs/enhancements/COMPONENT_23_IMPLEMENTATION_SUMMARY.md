## Technical Implementation Details

### Code Architecture

**File:** `/src/components/osi/LayerExplanationBuilder.tsx`

- Lines: 901 (with enhanced functionality)
- Interfaces: 2 new + inherited types
- Helper Functions: 7 core functions
- State Variables: 7 managed states
- Modes: 5 interactive modes

### State Management

```typescript
// Primary states
const [layers, setLayers] = useState<OSILayer[]>();
const [currentMode, setCurrentMode] = useState<1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5>(1);
const [hintsUsed, setHintsUsed] = useState<number>(0);
const [score, setScore] = useState<number>(0);
const [quizAnswers, setQuizAnswers] = useState<Record<string, string>>({});
const [selectedExample, setSelectedExample] = useState<number>(0);
```

### Key Functions

| Function                 | Purpose                         | Complexity |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ---------- |
| calculateLayerCompletion | Check 4-field completion status | Low        |
| calculateScore           | Comprehensive scoring system    | Medium     |
| calculateQuizScore       | Quiz assessment                 | Low        |
| generateStudyNotes       | Export note generation          | Medium     |
| exportAsText             | File download mechanism         | Low        |
| toggleProtocol           | Protocol selection handler      | Low        |
| updateLayer              | Layer data updates              | Low        |

### Data Integration

- Integrates with LAYER_FUNCTIONS (correct/incorrect options)
- Uses PROTOCOLS list (35+ protocols with port numbers)
- Leverages PDUS definitions
- Employs LAYER_COLORS (7 distinct colors)
- References LAYER_NAMES (layer terminology)

---

## Scoring System

### Distribution

- **Primary Function:** 25% weight
- **Protocol Selection:** 25% weight
- **PDU Accuracy:** 10% weight
- **Explanation Quality:** 40% weight
- **Hint Penalty:** -10% per hint (max 3)

### Calculation

```
Score = ((PrimaryFunc + Protocols + PDU + Explanation) / MaxScore)
         * 100
         * (1 - HintPenalty)
```

### Examples

- Complete and correct with no hints: 100%
- Complete with 1 hint: ~90%
- Partial completion: 40-70%
- No completion: 0%
