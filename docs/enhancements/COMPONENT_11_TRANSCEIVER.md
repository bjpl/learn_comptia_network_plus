### 4. Troubleshooting Guide

**Four Common Issues:**

**Issue 1: No Link Light / Link Down**
- Causes: Dirty fiber, wrong type, incompatible wavelength, damage
- Solutions: Clean connectors, verify compatibility, check wavelength match, reseat, test cable

**Issue 2: Intermittent Connectivity / Packet Loss**
- Causes: Low optical power, EMI, loose connection, temperature, bend radius
- Solutions: Check dBm levels (-3 to -20 range), shield cables, secure connections, improve cooling, proper routing

**Issue 3: Incompatible Transceiver Error**
- Causes: Non-approved vendor, wrong form factor, speed mismatch, firmware
- Solutions: Use approved modules, verify form factor, match speeds, update firmware

**Issue 4: Distance Limitation Errors**
- Causes: Wrong transceiver variant, fiber type mismatch, power budget, fiber grade
- Solutions: Use -LR for distance, match fiber type, calculate budget, upgrade to OM4

**Optical Power Budget Education:**
- -3 to -10 dBm: Good signal
- -10 to -20 dBm: Acceptable
- Below -20 dBm: Investigate issues
- Power meter usage recommendations

### 5. Exam Preparation Module

**Key Exam Topics - LO 1.4:**
1. Form factor identification by size/speed/use
2. Speed capabilities (SFP=1G, SFP+=10G, QSFP+=40G, QSFP28=100G)
3. Distance limitations (SR/LR/ER designations)
4. Fiber compatibility (MMF vs SMF, wavelengths)
5. BiDi operation (single fiber, dual wavelength)
6. WDM technologies (CWDM vs DWDM)

**Common Exam Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Long-Distance Building Link**
- Question: 8km apart, 10Gbps required
- Answer: 10GBASE-LR (SFP+) with single-mode fiber
- Reasoning: Long range requires -LR, SMF needed for distance

**Scenario 2: Cost-Effective Rack Connection**
- Question: 5m, 10Gbps, minimize cost
- Answer: SFP+ DAC (Direct Attach Copper)
- Reasoning: Shortest distance, copper cheapest option

**Scenario 3: Compatibility Question**
- Question: SFP+ in SFP port compatibility
- Answer: Physical incompatibility - won't fit
- Note: SFP modules CAN work in SFP+ ports at 1G

**Scenario 4: Modern Datacenter Spine**
- Question: 100G, 100m distance
- Answer: QSFP28 100GBASE-SR4 with OM4
- Reasoning: Speed requirement, multimode distance acceptable

**Memory Aids:**
- "QSFP = Quad = 4x" - Always 4 channels
- "SR = Short, LR = Long, ER = Extended" - Distance recall
- "850 = Multimode, 1310/1550 = Single-mode" - Wavelength association
- "BiDi = Bi-directional = 1 fiber, 2 wavelengths" - Cost savings
