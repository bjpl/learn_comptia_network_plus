## Usage Examples

### Practice Mode

```tsx
<ScenarioSimulator
  examMode="practice"
  onComplete={(attempt) => {
    console.log(`Score: ${attempt.totalScore}/${attempt.maxScore}`);
  }}
/>
```

### Timed Exam

```tsx
<ScenarioSimulator
  examMode="timed"
  timeLimit={90 * 60} // 90 minutes
  scenarioId="hybrid-cloud-enterprise"
  onComplete={handleComplete}
  onAnalysis={handleAnalysis}
/>
```

### With Analysis

```tsx
<ScenarioSimulator
  examMode="practice"
  onAnalysis={(analysis) => {
    if (analysis.passStatus === 'pass-with-distinction') {
      awardBadge('network-expert');
    }
  }}
/>
```

---

## Integration Points

### Learning Dashboard

```typescript
const handleComplete = (attempt) => {
  recordAttempt({
    type: 'scenario',
    scenario_id: attempt.scenarioId,
    score: attempt.totalScore,
    max_score: attempt.maxScore,
    duration: attempt.endTime - attempt.startTime,
  });
};
```

### Badge System

```typescript
const handleAnalysis = (analysis) => {
  if (analysis.passStatus === 'pass-with-distinction') {
    awardBadge('network-master');
  }
};
```

### Study Plans

```typescript
const weakAreas = analysis.byPhase.filter((p) => p.score / p.maxScore < 0.7).map((p) => p.phaseId);

recommendFocusAreas(weakAreas);
```
