## Assessment Framework

### Evaluation Dimensions

**Completeness (0-100%)**

- Measures how many of 4 required features are covered
- Feature keyword detection
- Percentage calculation: (features_found / features_total) × 100

**Accuracy (0-100%)**

- Base score: 80%
- Penalties for conceptual errors
- Bonuses for detailed technical content
- Common mistakes detected and penalized

**Conciseness (0-100%)**

- Target: 200 words
- Full score: ≤200 words
- Penalty: 0.5% per word over limit
- Encourages focused summarization

**Overall Score**

```
Overall = (Completeness + Accuracy + Conciseness) / 3
```

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I use the original 6 articles still?**
A: Yes! All original articles remain fully functional. The 3 new articles are additions.

**Q: What's the best study sequence?**
A: Start with IoT (beginner) → NFV or 5G (intermediate) → All articles for comprehensive coverage.

**Q: How long does each article take?**
A: Typical time: 25-35 minutes reading + 10-15 minutes summary writing = 40-50 minutes per article.
