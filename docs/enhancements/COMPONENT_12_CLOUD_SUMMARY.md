## Feature Details

### 1. Terminology Tab

Organized cloud terminology across three categories:

#### Deployment Models

- **Public Cloud:** Accessible to general public, shared infrastructure, lower cost
- **Private Cloud:** Exclusively for one organization, higher control and security
- **Hybrid Cloud:** Combination of public and private clouds with integrated connectivity

#### Service Models

- **SaaS:** Software as a Service - ready-to-use applications (Office 365, Salesforce)
- **PaaS:** Platform as a Service - development environment (Azure App Service, Heroku)
- **IaaS:** Infrastructure as a Service - compute/storage/networking (EC2, Azure VMs)

#### Key Concepts

- **Scalability:** Ability to handle increased workload by adding resources
- **Elasticity:** Automatic adjustment of resources based on real-time demand
- **Multitenancy:** Multiple customers sharing same resources with logical separation
- **NFV:** Network Function Virtualization - replace hardware appliances with virtual functions

**UI Design:**

- Category filter buttons for quick navigation
- Responsive grid layout (auto-fill minmax 280px)
- Hover effects for better interactivity
- Color-coded cards for visual distinction

### 2. Service Comparison Tab

Interactive comparison matrix showing differences across service models:

| Aspect      | SaaS          | PaaS          | IaaS                 |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------------- |
| Management  | Fully managed | Code and data | OS, runtime, data    |
| Flexibility | None          | High          | Maximum              |
| Cost Model  | Per-user      | Pay-per-use   | Per-resource         |

- Bandwidth: $10/month
- **Total: $65/month**

**Medium Application**

- Compute: $300/month
- Storage: $100/month
- Bandwidth: $50/month
- **Total: $450/month**

**Enterprise System**

- Compute: $2000/month
- Storage: $1000/month
- Bandwidth: $500/month
- **Total: $3500/month**

**Exam Focus:**

- Understand cost components (compute, storage, bandwidth)

### 5. Exam Practice Tab

Four CompTIA Network+ style exam questions covering cloud concepts:

#### Question 1: Service Model Selection

**Question:** "A company needs to deploy applications without managing servers. Which service model?"

- Options: SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, FaaS
- **Correct Answer:** PaaS
- **Explanation:** PaaS provides platform without server management - deploy code and platform handles infrastructure.

#### Question 2: Hybrid Cloud Benefits

**Question:** "What is hybrid cloud best for?"

- Options: Unlimited scalability, Data residency requirements, Cost reduction, Simplified management
- **Correct Answer:** Data residency requirements
- **Explanation:** Hybrid clouds allow sensitive data on-premises (meeting regulations) while using public cloud for other workloads.

#### Question 3: Elasticity vs Scalability

**Question:** "Which allows automatic resource adjustment based on demand?"

- Options: Scalability, Elasticity, Multitenancy, Virtualization
- **Correct Answer:** Elasticity
- **Explanation:** Elasticity is automatic scaling based on real-time demand, while scalability is capacity to handle load.

#### Question 4: Data Isolation

**Question:** "How is customer data isolated in multi-tenant clouds?"

- Options: Separate servers, Separate regions, VPCs and security groups, Only encryption
- **Correct Answer:** VPCs and security groups
- **Explanation:** Multi-tenant uses logical isolation (VPCs, network policies) to separate customer data in shared infrastructure.

**Exam Features:**

- Radio button selection for each option
- Instant feedback on answer submission
- Visual feedback (green for correct, red for incorrect)
- Detailed explanation with each answer
- Questions cover key Network+ topics

**UI Design:**

- Card-based layout for each question
- Color-coded feedback (green/red borders)
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Hover effects on options
