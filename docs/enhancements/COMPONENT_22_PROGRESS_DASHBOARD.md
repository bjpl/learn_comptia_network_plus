## Key Metrics Calculated

### Exam Readiness

- Overall score: Aggregate of all domain scores
- Domain scores: Average of LO scores per domain
- Confidence level: Based on overall score thresholds
- Study time recommendation: Based on readiness gap

### Time Analysis

- Total minutes: Sum of all LO time spent
- Hours/minutes conversion: User-friendly display
- Average per LO: Total / number of LOs
- Domain breakdown: Time per category with percentages

### Analysis Engine

- Strength identification: Top 2 domains
- Weakness identification: Below 70% threshold
- Recommendation generation: 5 prioritized items
- Action item creation: 3 suggested next steps

## Code Quality

### File Sizes

- ProgressDashboardPage.tsx: 161 lines (well under limit)
