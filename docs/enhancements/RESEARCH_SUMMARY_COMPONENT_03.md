## CompTIA Network+ Troubleshooting Methodology (Official)

The exam tests a **7-step troubleshooting process**:

1. **Identify the Problem**
   - Gather information, question users
   - Document symptoms
   - Identify what changed

2. **Establish a Theory of Probable Cause**
   - Question the obvious
   - Consider multiple approaches (top-down, bottom-up OSI)
   - Divide and conquer

3. **Test the Theory**
   - Confirm theory → plan next steps
   - Theory rejected → new theory or escalate

4. **Establish a Plan of Action**
   - Identify potential effects
   - Plan remediation

5. **Implement the Solution or Escalate**
   - Execute fix
   - Escalate if needed

6. **Verify Full System Functionality**
   - Confirm resolution
   - Implement preventive measures

7. **Document Findings**
   - Record entire process
   - Create knowledge base entry

**Exam Weight:** ~24% of Network+ exam (largest domain)
