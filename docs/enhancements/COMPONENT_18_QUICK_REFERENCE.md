## How to Use

### For Students

1. Select an article from the list
2. Read the content (expandable section)
3. Write a summary covering all 4 required features
4. Submit for auto-evaluation
5. Review scores and feedback
6. Revise to achieve 90%+ score

### For Instructors

- Access comprehensive learning objective coverage
- Track student mastery of modern technologies
- Use feedback to identify knowledge gaps
- Leverage 3 difficulty levels for differentiated instruction

## Evaluation Criteria

Each summary is scored on:

- **Completeness (0-100%)** - Coverage of required features
- **Accuracy (0-100%)** - Technical correctness
- **Conciseness (0-100%)** - Word count efficiency (target: 200 words)

**Overall Score** = Average of three metrics

### Feedback System
