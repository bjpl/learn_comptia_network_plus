   - Measures how many required features are covered
   - Feature detection through keyword matching
   - Encourages comprehensive understanding

2. **Accuracy (0-100%)**
   - Technical correctness assessment
   - Penalizes common conceptual errors (IPv4/IPv6 confusion, OSI layer errors)
   - Awards bonus points for including specific technical details
   - Base score: 80%, adjustable by Â±10%

3. **Conciseness (0-100%)**
   - 200-word target limit
   - Full score for summaries up to 200 words
   - Penalty of 0.5% per word over limit
   - Encourages focused, essential content

**Overall Score:** Average of all three metrics

### Feedback Generation

The system provides targeted feedback:

- Missing feature coverage with specific gaps listed
- Word count violations with exact counts
- Accuracy warnings for technical issues
- Performance tiers (90%+ excellent, 70-90% good, <70% needs improvement)

## Integrated Learning Features

## Implementation Details

### Component Architecture

```typescript
// Core state management
const [selectedArticle, setSelectedArticle] = useState<TechnologyArticle | null>(null);
const [summaries, setSummaries] = useState<{ [key: string]: string }>({});
const [evaluationResult, setEvaluationResult] = useState<TechnologySummary | null>(null);

// Feature definitions for articles
const categoryInfo: Record<TechnologyCategory, { name: string; features: string[] }>;
const modernTechInfo: Record<string, { name: string; features: string[] }>;
```

### Data Structure

**TechnologyArticle Interface:**

```typescript
interface TechnologyArticle {
  id: string; // Unique identifier
  title: string; // Article title
  category: TechnologyCategory; // Classification
  content: string; // Full article text
  wordCount: number; // Content length
  keyTopics: string[]; // Topic tags
  difficulty: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced';
}
```

### Evaluation Logic

**Feature Detection Algorithm:**

1. Normalize summary text to lowercase
2. Check for feature keywords (case-insensitive)
3. Filter out nested keywords (e.g., "Layer 2 over Layer 3")
4. Calculate completeness percentage
5. Apply accuracy penalties/bonuses
6. Generate contextualized feedback
