## Location
`/ports/trainer` route
File: `src/components/protocols/PortProtocolTrainer.tsx`

## Key Features

### 1. Spaced Repetition Algorithm (Leitner System)
- **5-Box Leitner System**: Cards progress through boxes based on mastery
- **Intelligent Scheduling**:
  - Box 1: Review immediately
  - Box 2: Review after 1 day
  - Box 3: Review after 3 days
  - Box 4: Review after 7 days
  - Box 5: Review after 14 days (mastered)
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: Cards move up on correct answers, down on incorrect
- **Due Card Queue**: Only shows cards that are due for review
- **Accuracy Tracking**: Per-card accuracy percentage

### 2. Memory Palace with Visual Mnemonics
Organized by port ranges for spatial memory reinforcement:

#### Port Range Rooms
- **20-30**: FTP, SSH, Telnet, SMTP (foundation protocols)
- **50-100**: DNS, DHCP, TFTP, HTTP (core services)
- **100-200**: POP3, NTP, IMAP, SNMP (email and management)
- **300-500**: LDAP, HTTPS, SMB, Syslog (security and directory)
- **500+**: SMTP submission, LDAPS, secure protocols, RDP, SIP

#### Mnemonic Examples
- **Port 22 (SSH)**: "22 pairs of secure locks"
- **Port 23 (Telnet)**: "Michael Jordan #23 - obsolete like Telnet"
- **Port 80 (HTTP)**: "80 miles per hour on the information highway"
- **Port 443 (HTTPS)**: "443 - 4 for S (secure), double security"
- **Port 3389 (RDP)**: "3389 - remote desktop connection"

### 3. Flashcard Mode with Progressive Difficulty
- **Smart Card Display**: Shows only port number initially
- **Reveal System**: Click to see protocol, service, description
- **Color-Coded Security**: Visual indicators for secure/insecure/optional
- **TCP/UDP Badges**: Clear protocol type identification
- **Exam Critical Markers**: Highlights must-know ports
- **Self-Assessment**: Correct/Incorrect buttons for honest review

### 4. Timed Exam Simulation Mode
- **10-Question Quizzes**: Random selection from exam-critical ports
- **Question Types**:
  1. Port to Protocol: "What protocol uses port 80?"
  2. Protocol to Port: "What is the default port for HTTPS?"
  3. TCP/UDP: "Does port 53 use TCP or UDP?"
  4. Security: "Is SMTP port 25 considered secure?"
- **Multiple Choice**: 4 options per question
- **Time Tracking**: Records time per question and total time
- **Immediate Feedback**: Shows correct answers and explanations
- **Score Display**: Percentage score with breakdown
- **Quiz History**: Tracks all quiz scores over time

### 5. Performance Tracking & Analytics Dashboard
- **Level System**: XP-based progression (Level = √(XP/100) + 1)
- **XP Rewards**:
  - Correct answer: 10 XP × (Box + 1)
  - Incorrect answer: 5 XP (participation reward)
  - Higher boxes give more XP
- **Study Streak**: Consecutive days studied
- **Mastery Metrics**:
  - Total cards mastered (Box 5)
  - Overall accuracy percentage
  - Total review count
- **Leitner Box Distribution**: Visual bar chart of card distribution
- **Quiz Performance**: Average quiz score tracking
