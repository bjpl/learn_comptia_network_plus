## Features Implemented

### 1. Scan Type Simulators

#### TCP Connect Scan
- **Stealth Level**: Low (Non-Stealth)
- **Detection Risk**: HIGH
- **How it works**:
  1. Scanner sends SYN packet
  2. Target responds with SYN-ACK (open) or RST (closed)
  3. Scanner sends ACK to complete 3-way handshake
  4. Scanner sends RST to close connection
- **Advantages**:
  - Most accurate results
  - Works through most firewalls
  - Clear service identification
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Easily logged in application logs
  - IDS detection is guaranteed
  - Slower than stealth scans
- **Use Cases**:
  - Troubleshooting connectivity issues
  - When stealth is not a concern
  - Verifying service availability

#### SYN Scan (Stealth/Half-Open)
- **Stealth Level**: High
- **Detection Risk**: MEDIUM
- **How it works**:
  1. Scanner sends SYN packet
  2. Target responds with SYN-ACK (open) or RST (closed)
  3. Scanner sends RST to abort (connection never completed)
- **Advantages**:
  - Faster than TCP Connect
  - Less likely to be logged in application logs
  - Default nmap scan type
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Requires raw socket access (root/admin)
  - Still detectable by IDS
  - May be blocked by stateful firewalls
- **Use Cases**:
  - Default network reconnaissance
  - Security assessments
  - Penetration testing

#### UDP Scan
- **Stealth Level**: High
- **Detection Risk**: LOW
- **How it works**:
  1. Scanner sends UDP packet to port
  2. Closed port: ICMP Port Unreachable response
  3. Open port: Usually no response (or service response)
  4. Filtered: No response at all
- **Result Interpretation**:
  - ICMP Unreachable = Closed
  - No response = Open|Filtered (ambiguous)
  - Service response = Open
- **Advantages**:
  - Discovers UDP services (DNS, SNMP, DHCP)
  - Very stealthy
  - Less commonly performed
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Extremely slow (relies on timeouts)
  - Ambiguous results
  - Can trigger rate limiting
- **Use Cases**:
  - DNS server discovery
  - SNMP detection
  - DHCP server identification

#### ACK Scan (Firewall Detection)
- **Stealth Level**: High
- **Detection Risk**: LOW
- **Purpose**: Firewall rule mapping (does NOT find open ports)
- **How it works**:
  1. Scanner sends unsolicited ACK packet
  2. Unfiltered port: RST response
  3. Filtered port: No response or ICMP unreachable
- **Results**:
  - "Unfiltered" = Firewall allows traffic
  - "Filtered" = Firewall blocking traffic
- **Use Cases**:
  - Mapping firewall rules
  - Detecting stateful vs stateless firewalls
  - Network security assessment

#### Banner Grabbing
- **Stealth Level**: Low (Non-Stealth)
- **Detection Risk**: HIGH
- **How it works**:
  1. Complete TCP connection to service
  2. Send protocol-specific request
  3. Capture service banner/version information
  4. Analyze for known vulnerabilities
- **Information Gathered**:
  - Service version
  - Operating system hints
  - Application configuration
  - Potential vulnerabilities
- **Security Implications**:
  - Fully logged connection
  - May trigger security alerts
  - Reveals scanner's IP address
- **Use Cases**:
  - Vulnerability assessment
  - Patch management
  - Security auditing

### 2. Port State Visualization

#### Port States Explained

**Open**
- Service is actively listening on the port
- Responds to connection attempts
- Security implication: Potential attack vector
- Example: Web server on port 80/443

**Closed**
- No service listening on port
- Port is accessible (not filtered)
- Returns RST packet
- Security implication: Reveals system is active

**Filtered**
- Firewall or packet filter blocking access
- No response received
- Cannot determine if service exists
- Security implication: Defense mechanism active

**Open|Filtered** (UDP-specific)
- Cannot definitively determine state
- No response received (common for UDP)
- Could be open OR filtered
- Requires additional testing

**Unfiltered** (ACK scan specific)
- Port is accessible (not blocked)
- Does NOT indicate if service is running
- Only reveals firewall configuration
- Used for firewall rule mapping

### 3. Packet Exchange Analysis

Each scan displays detailed packet-level exchanges:

```
Step 1: üì° Scanner ‚Üí üñ•Ô∏è Target [SYN]
        "Scanner initiates connection"

Step 2: üñ•Ô∏è Target ‚Üí üì° Scanner [SYN-ACK]
        "Target accepts connection"
        üö® Logged/Detected

Step 3: üì° Scanner ‚Üí üñ•Ô∏è Target [ACK]
        "Handshake complete"
        üö® Logged/Detected

Step 4: üì° Scanner ‚Üí üñ•Ô∏è Target [RST]
        "Scanner terminates"
        üö® Logged/Detected
```

Visual indicators show:
- Packet direction (Scanner ‚Üî Target)
- TCP flags used [SYN, ACK, RST, FIN]
- Detection status
- Step-by-step explanation

### 4. Defense Mechanisms

#### Firewall (Port Filtering)
- **Function**: Blocks or allows traffic based on port rules
- **Configuration**: Per-port allow/block/rate-limit rules
- **Effect on Scans**:
  - Blocked ports return "filtered" state
  - Allowed ports show actual service state
  - Demonstrates packet filtering

#### IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection/Prevention)
- **Function**: Monitors network for suspicious patterns
- **Detection Triggers**:
  - Multiple connection attempts
  - SYN scan patterns
  - Port sweep activities
- **Effect on Scans**:
  - Flags detected scans with üö® alerts
  - Logs scanner IP address
  - May trigger countermeasures

#### Rate Limiting
- **Function**: Throttles scan speed
- **Purpose**: Prevents rapid port sweeps
- **Effect**: Slows down automated scanning
- **Real-world**: Prevents DoS from scan activity

#### Port Knocking
- **Function**: Hides services behind sequence requirement
- **How it works**: Must connect to ports in specific order
- **Security benefit**: Obscures actual service ports
- **Example**: Connect to 1234, 5678, 9012 to open SSH

### 5. Stealth vs Non-Stealth Comparison

| Feature | TCP Connect | SYN Scan | UDP Scan | ACK Scan |
|---------|-------------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Stealth** | ‚ùå Low | ‚úÖ High | ‚úÖ High | ‚úÖ High |
| **Speed** | Medium | Fast | Very Slow | Fast |
| **Accuracy** | High | High | Medium | N/A |
| **Detection** | üî¥ HIGH | üü° MEDIUM | üü¢ LOW | üü¢ LOW |
| **Logged** | ‚úÖ Always | ‚ö†Ô∏è Sometimes | ‚ùå Rarely | ‚ùå Rarely |
| **Root Required** | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Purpose** | Service Detection | Reconnaissance | UDP Services | Firewall Mapping |

### 6. Educational Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Web Server Security Audit
**Target**: Port 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS)
**Finding**: HTTP open but unencrypted
**Recommendation**: Redirect HTTP to HTTPS, implement HSTS
**Exam Tip**: Always recommend encryption for sensitive data

#### Scenario 2: Database Exposure
**Target**: Port 3306 (MySQL) open to internet
**Risk Level**: CRITICAL
**Recommendation**:
- Firewall to block public access
- VPN-only access
- Network segmentation
**Exam Tip**: Database ports should NEVER be internet-facing

#### Scenario 3: Legacy Protocol Detection
**Target**: Port 23 (Telnet) open
**Risk Level**: CRITICAL
**Issue**: All traffic sent in plaintext
**Recommendation**:
- Replace with SSH (port 22)
- Immediate shutdown if not required
**Exam Tip**: Telnet is obsolete and inexcusable on modern networks

   - UDP: Connectionless, fast, no guaranteed delivery

2. **Firewall vs ACL**
   - Firewall: Stateful, tracks connections, Layer 4-7
   - ACL: Stateless, packet-by-packet, Layer 3-4

3. **Security Through Obscurity**
   - Changing default ports (e.g., SSH from 22 to 2222)
   - NOT a replacement for real security
   - Reduces automated attack surface

4. **Troubleshooting Port Issues**
   - Closed = Service not running
   - Filtered = Firewall blocking
   - Open = Service accessible
   - Test with: telnet, nmap, netcat

5. **Defense Best Practices**
   - Disable unnecessary services
   - Use strong authentication
   - Implement network segmentation
   - Keep services updated
   - Monitor for suspicious activity

### Key Algorithms

#### Port State Determination
```typescript
function determinePortState(
  scanType: ScanType,
  exchanges: PacketExchange[],
  isFiltered: boolean
): PortState {
  // Firewall blocking?
  if (isFiltered) {
    return scanType === 'udp-scan' ? 'open|filtered' : 'filtered';
  }

  // ACK scan only shows filtered/unfiltered
  if (scanType === 'ack-scan') {
    return lastResponse === 'TIMEOUT' ? 'filtered' : 'unfiltered';
  }

  // UDP ambiguity
  if (scanType === 'udp-scan') {
    return hasICMPUnreachable ? 'closed' : 'open|filtered';
  }

  // TCP-based scans
  return hasSYN_ACK || hasBanner ? 'open' : 'closed';
}
```

#### Detection Simulation
```typescript
function simulateDetection(
  scanType: ScanType,
  idsEnabled: boolean,
  exchanges: PacketExchange[]
): boolean {
  // TCP Connect always logged
  if (scanType === 'tcp-connect') return true;

  // IDS can detect stealth scans
  if (idsEnabled) {
    return exchanges.some(e => e.type.includes('SYN-ACK'));
  }

  return false;
}
```

### Data Structures

```typescript
interface ScanResult {
  port: number;
