### Common Implementation Patterns

#### Network Device Configuration (Ansible)

```yaml
---
- name: Configure network devices
  hosts: routers
  gather_facts: no

  vars:
    ntp_servers:
      - time1.example.com
      - time2.example.com

  tasks:
    - name: Set hostname
      cisco.ios.ios_config:
        lines:
          - hostname {{ inventory_hostname }}

    - name: Configure NTP
      cisco.ios.ios_config:
        lines:
          - 'ntp server {{ item }}'
        parents: 'ip ntp'
      loop: '{{ ntp_servers }}'
```

#### Infrastructure Provisioning (Terraform)

```hcl
variable "vpc_cidr" {
  type        = string
  description = "VPC CIDR block"
  default     = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block           = var.vpc_cidr
  enable_dns_hostnames = true
  enable_dns_support   = true
}

resource "aws_subnet" "public" {
  count      = 2
  vpc_id     = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block = cidrsubnet(var.vpc_cidr, 8, count.index)
}
```
