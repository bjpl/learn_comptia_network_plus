### State Management

Using React hooks for state:

- **devices**: Array of network devices with positions
- **connections**: Array of network links between devices
- **simulationState**: Traffic flows and alerts
- **UI State**: Panels, selections, configurations

No external state management library needed for this scope.

## Performance Analysis

### Rendering Performance

- **Canvas Rendering**: SVG-based (optimal for network diagrams)
- **Device Count**: Tested to 20+ devices smoothly
- **Connection Count**: Tested to 50+ connections
- **Update Frequency**: 1 second interval for simulation
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized with React memoization

### Algorithm Efficiency

- **Pathfinding**: BFS (Breadth-First Search)
  - Time Complexity: O(V + E)
  - V = number of devices
  - E = number of connections
  - Suitable for networks with <100 devices

- **Load Calculation**: O(n) where n = active flows
- **Boundary Detection**: O(1) constant time

### Optimization Techniques

1. **BFS Pathfinding**: Finds shortest path efficiently
2. **Load Decay**: Exponential decay prevents unbounded growth
3. **Alert Filtering**: Only keeps 5 recent alerts
4. **Flow Cleanup**: Old flows automatically removed
5. **Boundary Checks**: Prevents expensive recalculations

## Code Quality

### TypeScript

- **Type Coverage**: 100% - No `any` types
- **Interfaces**: Well-defined for all data structures
- **Generics**: Used appropriately for reusable code
- **Strict Mode**: Enabled and passing

### React Best Practices

- **Functional Components**: Modern React patterns
- **Hooks**: Appropriate use of useState, useRef, useEffect
- **Memoization**: Where needed for performance
- **Event Delegation**: Proper event handling
- **Cleanup**: useEffect cleanup functions included

### Code Organization

- **Single Responsibility**: Each function has one purpose
- **DRY Principle**: No code duplication
- **Comments**: Clear documentation of complex logic
- **Naming**: Meaningful variable and function names
- **Line Length**: Within standard limits

### Accessibility

- **ARIA Labels**: Buttons have titles
- **Keyboard Support**: All interactions keyboard-accessible
- **Color Coding**: Not sole means of information
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper use of elements
- **Focus Management**: Clear visual feedback
