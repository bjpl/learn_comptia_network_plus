3. Fill in:
   - Primary function (select from dropdown)
   - Protocols (check 2-3 correct ones)
   - PDU name (e.g., "Packet", "Frame", "Segment")
   - Interaction explanation (write 150+ words about how layer interacts with others)
4. Watch completion indicator change as you complete fields
5. Click "Calculate Score" to see how well you did

### Mode 2: Protocol Master

**Purpose:** Master protocol-to-layer mapping and port numbers

**How to Use:**

1. Click "Protocol Master" tab
2. View all 7 layers with their associated protocols
3. Study which protocols belong to each layer
4. Note port numbers for exam preparation
5. Use as reference while studying for CompTIA Network+

### Mode 3: Real-World Examples

**Purpose:** See how layers work in actual networking scenarios

**How to Use:**

1. Click "Real-World Examples" tab
2. Click any scenario button (e.g., "Web Browsing", "Email Transfer")
3. Read the practical scenario description
4. Note the key protocols involved in that layer
5. Repeat for all 8 scenarios to understand layer applications

### Mode 4: Quiz Mode

**Purpose:** Test your OSI knowledge

**How to Use:**

1. Click "Quiz Mode" tab
2. Read each question carefully
3. Click the button for your answer
4. Selected answers highlight in green
5. Click "Submit Quiz" when finished
6. View your score percentage

### Mode 5: Export & Review

**Purpose:** Generate study materials and track progress

**How to Use:**

1. Click "Export & Review" tab
2. Review your progress in the grid
3. Click "Preview Notes" to see what will be exported
4. Click "Download as TXT" to save study notes to your computer
5. Use downloaded notes for offline studying or printing

## Key Features

### Scoring System

- **Primary Function** (25%): Selecting correct layer functions
- **Protocols** (25%): Choosing correct protocols for the layer
- **PDU** (10%): Identifying correct Protocol Data Unit name
- **Explanation** (40%): Writing thorough layer interaction descriptions
- **Hint Penalty**: -10% per hint used (max 3 hints)

### Completion Status Indicators

- **✓** = Complete (all 4 fields filled correctly)
- **◐** = Partial (some fields filled)
- **○** = Empty (not started)

### Layer Colors

Each layer has a unique color for visual learning:

- Layer 7 (Application): Red/Orange
- Layer 6 (Presentation): Purple
- Layer 5 (Session): Yellow
- Layer 4 (Transport): Green
- Layer 3 (Network): Blue
- Layer 2 (Data Link): Cyan
- Layer 1 (Physical): Gray

## Tips for Success

### For Layer Builder Mode

- Start from Layer 7 and work downward
- Use textbooks for layer functions (multiple choice helps)
- Select protocols you've heard of first, then verify
- Write explanations in your own words

### For Protocol Master Mode

- Memorize critical protocols:
  - Layer 7: HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, DNS
  - Layer 4: TCP, UDP
  - Layer 3: IP, ICMP, OSPF
  - Layer 2: Ethernet, ARP
  - Layer 1: Physical cables, signals

### For Real-World Examples Mode

- Connect each scenario to protocols you've learned
- Think about troubleshooting from each layer's perspective
- Consider what happens if that layer fails

### For Quiz Mode

- Try without looking at other modes first
- Use it to identify weak areas
- Retake quiz after studying weak areas
- Aim for 100% to verify mastery

### For Study Material Export

- Export after each study session
- Build a library of study notes
- Use for review before exams
- Share notes with study groups

## CompTIA Network+ Exam Prep

This component aligns with:

- Domain 1.0: Networking Fundamentals
- Objective 1.1: OSI model and data encapsulation
- Protocols and port numbers knowledge
- Real-world troubleshooting scenarios

## Common Questions

**Q: How long should explanations be?**
A: Minimum 150 words. Quality matters more than quantity.

**Q: Can I retake the quiz?**
A: Yes! Switch to another mode and back to Quiz Mode to reset answers.

**Q: What if I don't know a protocol?**
A: Use hints in Layer Builder mode. Each hint costs 10% from final score.

**Q: How is my score calculated?**
A: Each section contributes to overall score. Perfect score = 100% (or less if hints used).

**Q: Can I print my study notes?**
A: Yes! Download the TXT file and print it from your file manager.

## Study Path Recommendation

### Week 1: Foundation

1. Start with Mode 3 (Real-World Examples) - 30 minutes
2. Move to Mode 2 (Protocol Master) - 30 minutes
3. Begin Mode 1 (Layer Builder) - 1 hour
4. Leave in "pending" state if needed

### Week 2: Building Knowledge

1. Continue Mode 1 (Layer Builder) - 1-2 hours
2. Reference Mode 2 (Protocol Master) while working
3. Return to Mode 3 (Real-World Examples) for context

### Week 3: Assessment

1. Complete Mode 1 (Layer Builder) fully
2. Generate study notes via Mode 5 (Export & Review)
3. Take quiz in Mode 4 (Quiz Mode) - aim for 80%+
4. Review weak areas using Mode 2 (Protocol Master)

### Final Week Before Exam

1. Retake Mode 4 (Quiz Mode) repeatedly - aim for 100%
2. Use Mode 5 (Export & Review) to print final notes
3. Study printed notes during spare time
4. Review Mode 3 (Real-World Examples) for practical context
