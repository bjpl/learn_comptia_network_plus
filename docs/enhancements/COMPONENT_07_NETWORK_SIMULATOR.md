**Component Location**: `src/components/appliances/NetworkSimulator.tsx` (928 lines)
**Scenarios Location**: `src/components/appliances/simulator-scenarios.ts` (218 lines)

## Features Implemented

### 1. Drag-and-Drop Device Placement

Users can build networks by adding and positioning network devices:

```typescript
// Add devices with intelligent positioning
addDevice('router'); // Adds a router
addDevice('switch'); // Adds a switch
addDevice('firewall-stateful'); // Adds a firewall
addDevice('load-balancer'); // Adds a load balancer
addDevice('wireless-controller'); // Adds a wireless controller
```

**Functionality**:

- Click device type buttons to add devices to canvas
- Drag devices to reposition them on the canvas
- Automatic boundary detection prevents dragging off-canvas
- Visual feedback shows selected devices with blue ring
- Load indicators display real-time device utilization

**Device Types**:

- **Router**: Layer 3 device for routing between networks
- **Switch**: Layer 2 device for LAN connectivity
- **Firewall**: Security device for traffic inspection
- **Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic across multiple devices
- **Wireless Controller**: Manages wireless network infrastructure

### 2. Connection Simulation with Packet Flow

Create connections between devices with visual packet flow representation:

```typescript
// Connection workflow
1. Click 🔗 button on source device
2. Click target device to complete connection
3. Connections show bandwidth and latency information
4. Active connections animate to show traffic flow
```

**Connection Features**:

- **Types**: Ethernet, Fiber, Wireless, VPN
- **Bandwidth Specification**: Configurable throughput (100 Mbps, 1 Gbps, etc.)
- **Latency Tracking**: Connection latency in milliseconds
- **Traffic Load**: Real-time traffic visualization
- **Visual Animation**: Dashed lines animate for active connections
- **Color Coding**: Green for active, gray for idle connections

**Connection Properties**:

```typescript
interface NetworkConnection {
  id: string;
  sourceId: string;
  targetId: string;
  type: 'ethernet' | 'fiber' | 'wireless' | 'vpn';
  bandwidth: string;
  latency?: number;
  trafficLoad?: number;
}
```

### 3. Configuration Panels for Each Device

Click the configuration button (⚙) on any device to access its settings:

**Device Configuration Properties**:

- **Device Name**: Rename devices for clarity
- **Throughput**: Set bandwidth capacity (e.g., "100 Mbps", "1 Gbps")
- **Max Connections**: Configure maximum simultaneous connections
- **Redundancy**: Enable/disable redundancy support

**Configuration Panel Features**:

- Real-time property editing
- Input validation for numeric fields
- Immediate application of changes
- Cancel option to discard unsaved changes

**Example Configuration**:

```typescript
{
  name: "Core Router",
  throughput: "500 Mbps",
  maxConnections: 5000,
  redundancy: true
}
```

### 4. Troubleshooting Scenarios

Three pre-configured network scenarios teach common design patterns and issues:

#### Scenario 1: Network Bottleneck

**Problem**: Single point of failure

- One router connects to three switches
- All traffic flows through the main router
- Single router failure causes complete network outage

**Expected Issue**: "The main router is a single point of failure"

**Hint**: "Consider adding a backup router with redundancy enabled"

**Learning Outcome**: Understand single points of failure and importance of redundancy

#### Scenario 2: Overloaded Device

**Problem**: Device operating near capacity

- Core router at 85% load (100 Mbps throughput)
- Web server at 90% load
- Connection at 95% traffic load

**Expected Issue**: "Devices are operating near maximum capacity"

**Hint**: "Consider upgrading throughput or adding load balancing"

**Learning Outcome**: Recognize capacity issues and optimization strategies

#### Scenario 3: Redundancy Setup

**Problem**: Design a resilient architecture

- Two firewalls (primary and secondary)
- Internal switch connects both firewalls
- No single point of failure

**Expected Issue**: "No single point of failure - good design"

**Hint**: "This is a recommended architecture for high availability"

**Learning Outcome**: Implement high-availability network design

**Loading a Scenario**:

1. Click "📋 Scenarios" button
2. Review scenario details, issue, and hint
3. Click "Load" to populate the canvas
4. Run simulation to observe behavior

### 5. Save/Load Network Designs

- Automatic timestamp recording
- All devices and connections preserved
- Session-independent storage

**Load Features**:

- List of previously saved designs with timestamps
- Load any saved design to canvas
- All previous connections and configuration restored
- Original simulation state reset

**Export Features**:

- Export network as JSON file
- Includes device positions, connections, and specifications
- Timestamp in filename for easy organization
- Can be shared or archived

**Save/Load Workflow**:

```typescript
// Save current design
1. Click "💾 Save/Load"
2. Enter network name
3. Click "Save"

// Load saved design
1. Click "💾 Save/Load"
2. View "Saved Designs" list
3. Click "Load" to restore
4. Or click "Delete" to remove

interface DeviceConfig {
  name: string;
  throughput: string;
  maxConnections: number;
  redundancy: boolean;
}

interface SavedNetwork {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  timestamp: number;

```

### Simulation Engine

**Packet Flow Logic**:

1. Random traffic flows generated between devices
2. BFS pathfinding finds optimal route through connections
3. Device loads updated based on active flows
4. Load decays over time (95% per second)
5. Alerts triggered when load exceeds thresholds

**Alert Thresholds**:

- Critical: Load > 90%
- Warning: Load > 70%
- Info: General notifications

**Traffic Flow Properties**:

```typescript
interface TrafficFlow {
  id: string;
  sourceDeviceId: string;
  targetDeviceId: string;
  connectionIds: string[]; // Path through network
  protocol: string; // HTTP, SSH, FTP, DNS
  bandwidth: number; // Percentage of capacity
  color: string; // Unique per flow
  animated: boolean; // Visual animation flag
}
```

## Usage Examples
