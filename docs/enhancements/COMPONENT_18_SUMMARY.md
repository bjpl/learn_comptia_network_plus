   - Encourages comprehensive understanding
   - Clear feature checklist provided

2. **Accuracy (0-100%)**
   - Technical correctness assessment
   - Penalty for conceptual errors
   - Bonus for detailed technical content
   - Base score: 80%

3. **Conciseness (0-100%)**
   - Target: 200 words
   - Full score: ≤200 words
   - Penalty: 0.5% per word over limit
   - Encourages focused synthesis

### Overall Score Calculation

```
Overall Score = (Completeness + Accuracy + Conciseness) / 3

Performance Tiers:
- 90%+: Excellent (exam ready)
