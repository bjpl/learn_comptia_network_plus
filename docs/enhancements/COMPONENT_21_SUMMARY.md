```

#### 6. Performance-Based Question Evaluation

- **Keyword Extraction:** Automatically identifies key terms from criteria
- **Answer Matching:** Matches user responses against criteria keywords
- **Partial Credit:** Awards points proportional to criteria matched
- **Automatic Feedback:** Generates feedback showing:
  - Criteria matched (with checkmarks)
  - Criteria missed (with suggestions)
  - Score earned/max score

---

## Technical Highlights

### Type Safety

```typescript
type QuestionType = 'multiple-choice' | 'simulation' | 'performance' | 'essay';
type ExamMode = 'practice' | 'timed' | 'tutorial';

interface ScoreAnalysis {
  totalScore: number;
  maxScore: number;
  percentage: number;
  byPhase: { phaseId: string; score: number; maxScore: number }[];
  byType: { type: QuestionType; score: number; maxScore: number }[];
  passStatus: 'pass' | 'fail' | 'pass-with-distinction';
}
```

### State Management

- **Efficient Updates:** Uses callback-based state updates
- **Memoization:** Critical functions use `useCallback` for performance
- **Lazy Initialization:** State only initialized when needed

### Performance Optimizations

- **Timer Efficiency:** Uses `NodeJS.Timeout` with proper cleanup
- **Conditional Rendering:** Phases only render when active
- **Minimal Re-renders:** State updates are granular and targeted

### Error Handling

- **TypeScript Strict Mode:** All types properly defined
- **Null Safety:** Proper optional chaining and nullish coalescing
- **Return Types:** All functions have explicit return types

## Component API

### Props

```typescript
interface ScenarioSimulatorProps {
  scenarioId?: string; // Auto-load specific scenario
  timeLimit?: number; // Time in seconds (for timed mode)
  examMode?: ExamMode; // 'practice' | 'timed' | 'tutorial'
  onComplete?: (attempt) => void; // Completion callback
  onAnalysis?: (analysis) => void; // Score analysis callback
}
```

### Usage Examples

**Practice Mode**

```tsx
<ScenarioSimulator
  examMode="practice"
  onComplete={(attempt) => {
    console.log(`Completed: ${attempt.totalScore}/${attempt.maxScore}`);
  }}
/>
```

**Timed Exam Mode**

```tsx
<ScenarioSimulator
  examMode="timed"
  timeLimit={90 * 60} // 90 minutes
  scenarioId="hybrid-cloud-enterprise"
  onAnalysis={(analysis) => {
    if (analysis.passStatus === 'fail') {
      // Offer retake
    }
  }}
/>
```

**With Score Analysis**

```tsx
const [analysis, setAnalysis] = useState<ScoreAnalysis | null>(null);

<ScenarioSimulator examMode="practice" onAnalysis={setAnalysis} />;

{
  analysis && (
    <div>
      <h2>Score: {analysis.percentage.toFixed(1)}%</h2>
      <p>Status: {analysis.passStatus}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

- Status badge (PASS/FAIL/PASS WITH DISTINCTION)
- Contextual feedback message
- Retake option (if failed)

---

## Scoring Algorithm

### Phase-by-Phase

1. User submits phase answers
2. Each assessment point is evaluated
3. Score calculated based on criteria matching
4. Feedback generated with matched/missed criteria
5. Phase score = sum of assessment point scores

### Pass Determination

```
Percentage = (Total Score / Max Score) * 100

If percentage >= 80%   → PASS WITH DISTINCTION
If percentage >= 70%   → PASS
If percentage < 70%    → FAIL
```

### Criterion Matching

1. Extract keywords from each criterion (3+ chars)
2. Count matches in user answer (case-insensitive)
3. If matches >= 30% of keywords → criterion matched
4. Score = (matched criteria / total criteria) × max score
