   - Best practice: Principle of least privilege

2. **Encryption** - Data protection in motion and at rest
   - At rest, In transit, Key management, TLS/SSL
   - Best practice: Always encrypt sensitive data

3. **Network Security** - Traffic control and inspection
   - Security groups, NACLs, WAF, Virtual firewalls
   - Best practice: Defense in depth

4. **Compliance** - Meeting regulatory requirements
   - HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR, FedRAMP
   - Best practice: Audit logging and monitoring

### Elasticity/Scaling Types

1. **Vertical Scaling** - Make servers bigger
   - Increase CPU, RAM on existing instances
   - Good for: Database servers

2. **Horizontal Scaling** - Add more servers
   - Deploy additional instances
   - Good for: Stateless web apps

3. **Auto-Scaling** - Automatic adjustment

## Tips for Exam Preparation

### Service Models

- Remember the "cloud responsibility matrix"
- SaaS = Vendor does most, you do least
- IaaS = You do most, vendor provides infrastructure
- PaaS = Balanced responsibility

### Deployment Models

- Public = Cost, Scale, Limited control
- Private = Control, Compliance, High cost
- Hybrid = Best of both, complex

### Connectivity

- VPN = Encrypted but variable performance
- Direct Connect = Expensive but predictable
- Internet = Free but unpredictable

### Security

- IAM = Who can do what
- Encryption = Data protection
- Network Security = Traffic control
- Compliance = Meeting regulations

### Elasticity

- Vertical = Single server enhancement
- Horizontal = More servers
- Auto = Dynamic response
- Serverless = No server management
