  "test:coverage": "vitest run --coverage",
  "test:e2e": "playwright test --config=playwright.config.ts",
  "test:e2e:ui": "playwright test --ui",
  "test:visual": "playwright test --grep @visual",
  "test:a11y": "playwright test --grep @a11y"
}
```

## Test Coverage Goals
- **Statements**: >90%
- **Branches**: >90%
- **Functions**: >90%
- **Lines**: >90%

## How to Run Tests

### Development
```bash
# Run all tests in watch mode
npm run test

# Run unit tests only
npm run test:unit

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run with UI
npm run test:ui

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run E2E with UI
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

### CI/CD
```bash
# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run visual regression tests
npm run test:visual

# Run accessibility tests
npm run test:a11y

# Full validation
npm run validate
```

## Key Features

### 1. Custom Test Matchers
```typescript
expect('192.168.1.1').toBeValidIPv4()
expect('255.255.255.0').toBeValidSubnetMask()
expect('00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E').toBeValidMACAddress()
```

- Web APIs (ResizeObserver, IntersectionObserver)
- Browser APIs (localStorage, sessionStorage, matchMedia)
- Network utilities for isolated testing

### 3. Multi-Browser Testing
- Desktop: Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- Mobile: Pixel 5, iPhone 12
- Tablet: iPad Pro

### 4. Performance Validation

- Screen reader compatibility

## Next Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Install Playwright Browsers**
   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   ```

3. **Run Initial Tests**
   ```bash
   npm run test:unit
   npm run test:integration
   ```

4. **Generate Coverage Report**
   ```bash
   npm run test:coverage
   ```

5. **Review Coverage**
   - Open `coverage/index.html` in browser
   - Identify areas needing more tests
