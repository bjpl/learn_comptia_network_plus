# CompTIA Network+ Platform - Priority Matrix

## Overview

This document defines the priority system for features, components, and work items across the CompTIA Network+ learning platform. Priorities are assigned using the MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have) combined with impact/effort analysis.

## Priority Decision Framework

### Questions to Determine Priority:

1. **Does it block other work?** → If yes, P0
2. **Is it required for platform to function?** → If yes, P0
3. **Is it a core CompTIA Network+ exam topic?** → If yes, P0 or P1
4. **Does it significantly improve user experience?** → If yes, P1
5. **Can we launch without it?** → If yes, P2 or lower
6. **Is it high impact and low effort?** → If yes, raise priority
7. **Is it low impact and high effort?** → If yes, lower priority

### Re-Prioritization Triggers:

- **User Feedback**: Strong demand for feature
- **Technical Blockers**: Dependencies discovered
- **Competitive Analysis**: Competitor launches similar feature
- **Resource Changes**: Team size or skills shift
- **Business Goals**: Strategic direction change
