- 1000 users in Year 1
- 70% certification pass rate
- Average user saves $200 on alternative courses

**Revenue Projections (Year 1):**
- Subscription model: 1000 users × $49 × 6 months avg = $294,000
- One-time model: 1000 users × $299 = $299,000

**ROI**: 100-120% in Year 1 (breaks even at ~500 users)
