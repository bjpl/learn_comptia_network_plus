## OSI Model Module

### Component 1: Layer Explanation Builder

**What it does**: Helps you build complete explanations for all 7 OSI layers.

**How to use it**:

1. **Click a layer** to expand it (they're color-coded!)
2. **Select primary function** from the dropdown (watch out for decoys!)
3. **Choose protocols** that belong to this layer (select 2-3)
4. **Enter the PDU name** (e.g., "Packet", "Frame", "Segment")
5. **Write your explanation** (minimum 150 words):
   - Describe what the layer does
   - Explain how it interacts with the layer above
   - Explain how it interacts with the layer below
   - Use technical terminology

6. **Calculate your score** when all layers are complete
7. **Use hints sparingly** (each hint = -10% final score)

**Tips for success**:
- Start with Layer 7 (Application) and work down to Layer 1 (Physical)
- For explanations, mention both adjacent layers by name
- Quality > quantity - 200 focused words beats 300 rambling words
- Check your PDU spelling (case doesn't matter, but spelling does)

**Example good explanation** (Layer 4 - Transport):
```
The Transport Layer (Layer 4) is responsible for end-to-end communication
between application processes. It receives data from Layer 5 (Session) and
segments it into smaller units that can be transmitted efficiently. Using
port numbers, it identifies which application should receive the data.

TCP and UDP are the main Layer 4 protocols. TCP provides reliable delivery
through acknowledgments, sequencing, and retransmissions. UDP offers faster,
connectionless delivery without reliability guarantees.

The Transport Layer passes segments down to Layer 3 (Network), which adds
IP addressing information. When receiving data, Layer 4 reassembles segments
in the correct order before passing complete data up to Layer 5.

Flow control through windowing prevents overwhelming the receiver. Error
recovery through retransmissions ensures data integrity. Port multiplexing
allows multiple applications to use the network simultaneously.
```

### Component 2: Packet Journey Simulator

**What it does**: Animates a packet traveling through all 7 layers, showing encapsulation and decapsulation.

**How to use it**:

1. **Press Play** to start the animation
2. **Watch closely** as headers are added (encapsulation) and removed (decapsulation)
3. **Try different speeds** (0.5x for detailed viewing, 2x when you understand it)
4. **Switch protocols** (TCP vs UDP) to see header differences
5. **Click any layer** in the packet visualization to inspect its headers
6. **Read header fields** in the inspection panel

**What you're seeing**:

- **Source Device** (left): Creates the packet
- **Packet Visualization** (center): Shows all headers + payload
- **Destination Device** (right): Receives and processes the packet

**Encapsulation (Steps 1-7)**:
- Layer 7: Application creates data (HTTP request)
- Layer 6: Presentation encrypts/formats data
- Layer 5: Session adds session information
- Layer 4: Transport adds TCP/UDP header
- Layer 3: Network adds IP header (source/dest IP)
- Layer 2: Data Link adds Ethernet header (source/dest MAC)
- Layer 1: Physical converts to bits for transmission

**Decapsulation (Steps 8-14)**:
- Reverse process: Each layer removes its header
- Layer 1: Receives bits, converts to frame
- Layer 2: Removes Ethernet header, checks MAC
- Layer 3: Removes IP header, checks routing
- Layer 4: Removes TCP/UDP header, checks port
- Layer 5: Session information processed
- Layer 6: Data decrypted/decompressed
- Layer 7: Application receives original data

**Common student questions**:

Q: *Why does the packet get bigger as it goes down?*
A: Each layer adds a header with control information. By Layer 1, the original data is wrapped in 6 headers!

Q: *What's the difference between TCP and UDP headers?*
A: TCP has more fields (Sequence, Ack, Window, Flags) for reliability. UDP is simpler with just Source Port, Dest Port, Length, Checksum.

Q: *Can I speed this up?*
A: Yes! Use the 2x speed button. But go slow first to really understand each layer's role.

### Component 3: Troubleshooting Scenarios

**What it does**: Tests your ability to identify which OSI layer is causing network problems in real-world scenarios.

**How to use it**:

1. **Read the scenario** carefully (example: "Users can't access websites by name")
2. **Identify the OSI layer** where the problem occurs
3. **Explain your reasoning** (minimum 100 words):
   - What symptom indicates this layer?
   - Why not a different layer?
   - What protocol/mechanism is failing?

4. **Suggest a solution** (minimum 50 words):
   - How would you fix this problem?
   - What tools would you use?
   - What layer-specific commands are relevant?

5. **Use hints if stuck** (doesn't affect score in practice mode)
6. **Review feedback** after submission to learn from mistakes

**Difficulty levels**:

- **Easy** (Green): Direct layer problems (e.g., cable unplugged = Layer 1)
- **Medium** (Orange): Requires understanding layer functions (e.g., MAC table = Layer 2)
- **Hard** (Red): Subtle distinctions between layers (e.g., SSL/TLS = Layer 6, not 7)

**Category filtering**:

Filter scenarios by problem type:
- **DNS**: Name resolution (Layer 7)
- **Routing**: Path selection, loops (Layer 3)
- **Security**: Attacks, encryption (varies by attack)
- **Physical Media**: Cables, signal issues (Layer 1)
- **Switching**: VLANs, MAC tables, STP (Layer 2)
- **Transport**: TCP/UDP issues, ports (Layer 4)
- **Wireless**: RF interference, CSMA/CA (Layer 1-2)

**Pro tips**:

1. **Think about what's actually broken**:
   - Can't resolve names but IPs work = DNS (Layer 7)
   - Can't route to network = Routing (Layer 3)
   - Cable signal degraded = Physical (Layer 1)

2. **Remember which protocols live where**:
   - HTTP, FTP, DNS = Layer 7
   - TCP, UDP = Layer 4
   - IP, ICMP = Layer 3
   - Ethernet, Wi-Fi = Layer 2

3. **Layer-specific troubleshooting**:
   - Layer 1: Check cables, lights, signal strength
   - Layer 2: Check MAC tables, VLANs, switch ports
   - Layer 3: Check routing tables, IP configs, gateways
   - Layer 4: Check port numbers, firewalls, TCP states
   - Layer 7: Check application logs, DNS, services

**Example scenario walkthrough**:

**Scenario**: "ICMP unreachable messages when pinging remote server"

**Thought process**:
1. ICMP = Internet Control Message Protocol
2. ICMP works with IP = Layer 3 protocol
3. "Unreachable" = routing issue
4. Router can't find path to destination

**Layer Selection**: Layer 3 (Network)

**Explanation**: "This is a Layer 3 issue because ICMP messages are generated by routers to report problems with IP packet delivery. When a router receives a packet for which it has no route, it sends an ICMP Destination Unreachable message back to the source. This indicates a problem with routing tables or network reachability at the Network Layer. While the user is trying to use ping (an application), the actual problem is at Layer 3 where IP packets are being discarded due to lack of routing information."

**Solution**: "Check routing tables on all routers in the path using 'show ip route'. Verify that routes to the destination network exist. If routes are missing, add static routes or configure a dynamic routing protocol (OSPF, EIGRP, BGP). Use traceroute to identify where packets are being dropped. Verify IP addressing and subnet masks are correct on all interfaces."

## Network Appliances Module

### Component 1: Comparison Matrix

**What it does**: Side-by-side comparison of network devices across specs, features, and total cost of ownership.

**How to use it**:

1. **Start with 3 default devices** (or customize initial selection)
2. **Add more devices** using the filter dropdowns:
   - Category: Physical / Virtual / Cloud
   - Type: Router / Switch / Firewall / Load Balancer

3. **Click column headers to sort**:
   - Click "Throughput" to find fastest devices
   - Click "Year 1 Total" to find most affordable
   - Click "5-Year Total" for long-term TCO
   - Click again to reverse sort direction

4. **Compare across categories**:
   - Basic Info: Who makes it, what type
   - Performance: How fast, how many connections
   - Features: What capabilities (✓ or ✗)
   - Pricing: Initial cost, annual costs, totals
   - Use Cases: Best for scenarios, pros/cons

5. **Remove devices** by clicking the × button
6. **Read summary** at bottom for quick insights

**Understanding the data**:

**Throughput**:
- Measured in Mbps (Megabits/sec) or Gbps (Gigabits/sec)
- Higher = faster, but consider your actual needs
- 100 Mbps adequate for small office
- 1+ Gbps for medium business
- 10+ Gbps for enterprise/data center

**Max Connections**:
- Simultaneous sessions the device can handle
- 1,000-10,000 for small office

- 500,000+ for enterprise

**Pricing explained**:
- **Initial Cost**: Hardware purchase price
- **Annual Maintenance**: Support contracts, software licenses
- **Power Cost**: Electricity usage (physical devices only)
- **Year 1 Total**: Initial + Maintenance + Power
- **5-Year Total**: Realistic long-term investment

**Example comparison**:

**Cisco ISR 4331 (Physical) vs pfSense Virtual (Virtual)**:

| Feature | Cisco ISR 4331 | pfSense Virtual |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| Initial Cost | $3,500 | $0 |
| Year 1 Total | $4,065 | $399 |
| 5-Year Total | $6,565 | $1,995 |
| Throughput | 100-300 Mbps | 1-10 Gbps |
| Max Connections | 5,000 | 50,000 |
| **Winner** | Enterprise support | Cost, performance |

6. **Observe status changes**:
   - Green: Healthy (load < 70%)
   - Yellow: Warning (load 70-90%)
   - Red: Error (load > 90%)

7. **Check alerts** panel for overload warnings

8. **Select device** to see detailed stats:
   - Current load percentage
   - Number of connections
   - Throughput capability

**Design patterns to try**:

**Pattern 1: Basic Star Topology**
```
        [Router]
        /  |  \
       /   |   \
    [SW] [SW] [SW]
```
- Central router connects 3 switches
- Simple, router is single point of failure
- Watch router load increase as traffic grows

**Pattern 2: Redundant Core**
```
    [Router1]━━[Router2]
       |  \  /  |
       |   ╳   |
       |  / \  |
     [SW1]  [SW2]
```
- Two core routers with cross-connects
- Resilient: remove any connection, traffic re-routes
- More complex to manage

**Pattern 3: Firewall Segmentation**
```
    [Router]━━[Firewall]━━[Switch]
```
- Firewall between router and internal network
- Watch firewall become bottleneck
- Learn why firewall sizing matters

**Understanding simulation alerts**:

**Critical** (Red):
- "Core Router is overloaded (95%)"
- Device can't handle traffic volume
- Solutions: Add capacity, distribute load

**Warning** (Yellow):
- "Firewall load high (75%)"
- Getting close to capacity
- Solutions: Monitor, plan upgrade

**Info** (Blue):
- "Traffic flow established"
- Normal operation
- No action needed

**Pro tips**:

1. **Start simple**: 2-3 devices, learn behavior
2. **Add gradually**: One device at a time
3. **Create loops**: See BFS pathfinding in action
4. **Test resilience**: Remove connections during simulation
5. **Observe patterns**: Where do bottlenecks form?
6. **Experiment**: No wrong answers, just learning!

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Technical Issues

**Issue**: Component won't load
- **Solution**: Refresh page, check internet connection
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Del)

**Issue**: Simulation is laggy
- **Solution**: Close other browser tabs, reduce device count
- Try Chrome/Edge instead of Firefox for better canvas performance

**Issue**: Can't see device connections in simulator
- **Solution**: Zoom out (Ctrl + -), or drag canvas view
- Connections are SVG lines - check browser supports SVG

**Issue**: Score seems wrong
- **Solution**: Review scoring rubric in component documentation
- Ensure you've met minimum word counts
- Check you selected correct options (not decoys)

### Common Learning Issues

**Issue**: "I don't understand the difference between layers"
- **Solution**: Use Packet Journey Simulator - watch it 10 times
- Focus on what each layer ADDS (header information)
- Layer 7 = User applications (HTTP, FTP)
- Layer 4 = End-to-end connections (TCP, UDP)
- Layer 3 = Routing between networks (IP)
- Layer 2 = Local network delivery (Ethernet, MAC)
- Layer 1 = Physical transmission (cables, bits)

**Issue**: "Decision tree always recommends virtual"
- **Solution**: Try different scenarios - answer questions differently
- If you have virtualization + low budget = virtual makes sense!
- Try: No virtualization + performance critical + $50k budget

**Issue**: "I'm failing scenario questions"
- **Solution**: Read scenario more carefully - look for keywords
- "DNS" = Layer 7, "Routing" = Layer 3, "MAC" = Layer 2
- Use hints to learn, don't worry about score initially
- Review feedback after wrong answers

**Issue**: "Simulator devices always turn red"
- **Solution**: This means they're overloaded - that's correct behavior!
- Reduce number of devices or add more paths
- This teaches you about capacity planning
