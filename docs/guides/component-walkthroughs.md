- Configure VLANs for network segmentation
- Implement spanning tree protocol (STP)
- Troubleshoot Layer 2 issues

#### ‚è±Ô∏è Estimated Time
- **First Pass**: 60-75 minutes
- **Review**: 25 minutes
- **Labs**: 45 minutes
- **Total**: 2-2.5 hours

#### üìã Prerequisites
- Physical Layer knowledge
- Understanding of network topologies
- Basic networking concepts

#### Component Walkthrough

**Step 1: Introduction to Layer 2 (10 minutes)**
1. Review the Layer 2 role: Reliable transfer between adjacent nodes
2. Watch "Data Link Layer Overview" video
3. Understand relationship with Physical Layer

üí° **Key Concept**: Layer 2 provides node-to-node communication on the same network segment using MAC addresses.

**Step 2: MAC Addressing (15 minutes)**

**MAC Address Structure**:
- 48 bits (6 bytes)
- Hexadecimal notation: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
- **OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier)**: First 3 bytes (vendor)
- **NIC Specific**: Last 3 bytes (unique to device)

**Example**: `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`
- `00:1A:2B`: OUI (manufacturer)
- `3C:4D:5E`: Device-specific

**Special MAC Addresses**:
- **Broadcast**: FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF (all devices)
- **Multicast**: Starts with 01:00:5E

üîß **Interactive Tool**: Use "MAC Address Explorer"
- Look up manufacturer by OUI
- Generate random MAC addresses
- Practice identifying address types

‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Pitfall**: MAC addresses are Layer 2 (local network), IP addresses are Layer 3 (routable). Don't confuse them!

**Step 3: Ethernet Frames (15 minutes)**

**Frame Structure**:
```
[ Preamble | Destination MAC | Source MAC | Type/Length | Data | FCS ]
    7 bytes      6 bytes         6 bytes      2 bytes    46-1500   4 bytes
```

**Frame Fields**:
- **Preamble**: Synchronization pattern
- **Destination MAC**: Target address
- **Source MAC**: Sender address
- **Type/Length**: Protocol (0x0800 = IPv4) or payload length
- **Data**: Payload (46-1500 bytes)
- **FCS (Frame Check Sequence)**: Error detection (CRC)

üí° **Key Concept**: Minimum frame size is 64 bytes; maximum is 1518 bytes (standard Ethernet).

üîß **Animation**: Watch "Frame Encapsulation Process"‚Äîsee how data is wrapped at each layer.

**Step 4: Switch Operations (15 minutes)**

**How Switches Work**:
1. **Learn**: Build MAC address table from source addresses
2. **Forward**: Send frames to specific ports
3. **Filter**: Don't flood unnecessary traffic
4. **Age**: Remove stale MAC addresses

**MAC Address Table**:
```
Port  | MAC Address       | Age (seconds)
------|-------------------|---------------
1     | 00:1A:2B:11:22:33 | 120
2     | 00:1A:2B:44:55:66 | 45
3     | 00:1A:2B:77:88:99 | 200
```

**Forwarding Process**:
1. Frame arrives on port
2. Learn source MAC and port
3. Check destination MAC in table
4. If found: forward to specific port
5. If not found: flood to all ports except incoming

üîß **Interactive Simulation**: "Switch Forwarding Lab"
- Send frames between devices
- Watch MAC address table populate
- Observe unicast, broadcast, and unknown unicast handling

üìù **Exam Tip**: Know the difference between a switch (layer 2, MAC-based) and hub (layer 1, broadcasts everything).

**Step 5: VLANs (Virtual LANs) (15 minutes)**

**VLAN Purpose**:
- Segment network logically, not physically
- Improve security (separate departments)
- Reduce broadcast domains
- Simplify management

**VLAN Configuration**:
- **Access Port**: Belongs to one VLAN
- **Trunk Port**: Carries multiple VLANs
- **VLAN Tagging**: 802.1Q adds 4-byte tag to frames

**Example Scenario**:
```
VLAN 10: Sales department
VLAN 20: Engineering department
VLAN 30: Management
```

Devices in VLAN 10 can't communicate with VLAN 20 without router (Layer 3).

üîß **Hands-On Lab**: "VLAN Configuration Simulator"
- Create VLANs on virtual switch
- Assign ports to VLANs
- Configure trunk port
- Test inter-VLAN isolation

‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Pitfall**: Forgetting that VLANs require a router or Layer 3 switch for inter-VLAN communication.

**Step 6: Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) (10 minutes)**

**Problem STP Solves**: Layer 2 loops
- Broadcast storms
- MAC address table instability
- Duplicate frames

**How STP Works**:
1. Elect root bridge (lowest priority/MAC)
2. Calculate shortest path to root
3. Block redundant paths
4. Create loop-free topology

**Port States**:
- **Blocking**: Receives BPDUs, doesn't forward
- **Listening**: Elects root, doesn't forward
- **Learning**: Builds MAC table, doesn't forward
- **Forwarding**: Normal operation
- **Disabled**: Administratively down

üí° **Key Concept**: STP prevents loops but introduces convergence time (30-50 seconds for topology changes).

üìù **Exam Tip**: Know that RSTP (Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol) is faster version with convergence under 1 second.

üîß **Interactive Demo**: "STP Convergence Visualizer"‚Äîsee how STP blocks ports to prevent loops.

**Step 7: Other Layer 2 Concepts (10 minutes)**

**Full-Duplex vs Half-Duplex**:
- **Half-Duplex**: Send OR receive (not both)‚Äîused with hubs
- **Full-Duplex**: Send AND receive simultaneously‚Äîmodern switches

**CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection)**:
- Legacy protocol for half-duplex
- Listen before sending
- Detect collisions and backoff
- Not used with full-duplex switches

**Port Security**:
- Limit MAC addresses per port
- Prevent unauthorized devices
- Modes: shutdown, restrict, protect

**VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP)**:
- Propagates VLAN config across switches
- Reduces administrative overhead
- Caution: Can accidentally delete VLANs!

**Step 8: Knowledge Check Quiz (10 minutes)**
Take the 20-question Data Link Layer quiz.

‚úÖ **Knowledge Check Questions**:
1. How many bytes is a MAC address?
2. What is the maximum Ethernet frame size?
3. What does a switch do when it receives a frame with unknown destination MAC?
4. What is the purpose of VLANs?
5. What problem does STP solve?
6. What is the difference between access and trunk ports?

**Step 9: Hands-On Labs (45 minutes)**

3. Grasp the difference between Layer 2 (local) and Layer 3 (routable)

üí° **Key Concept**: Layer 3 enables communication between different networks using logical (IP) addresses.

**Step 2: IPv4 Addressing (20 minutes)**

**IPv4 Address Structure**:
- 32 bits (4 bytes)
- Dotted decimal notation: XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
- Each octet: 0-255

**Example**: `192.168.1.100`

**Address Classes** (Historical but still tested):

| Class | First Octet | Default Mask   | Range               | Purpose          |
|-------|-------------|----------------|---------------------|------------------|
| A     | 1-126       | 255.0.0.0 (/8) | 1.0.0.0 - 126.255.255.255 | Large networks   |
| B     | 128-191     | 255.255.0.0 (/16) | 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.255.255 | Medium networks  |
| C     | 192-223     | 255.255.255.0 (/24) | 192.0.0.0 - 223.255.255.255 | Small networks   |
| D     | 224-239     | N/A            | Multicast addresses | Multicast        |
| E     | 240-255     | N/A            | Reserved            | Experimental     |

**Special Addresses**:
- **Loopback**: 127.0.0.1 (localhost)
- **Private Ranges** (RFC 1918):
  - Class A: 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
  - Class B: 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
  - Class C: 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255
- **APIPA**: 169.254.0.0/16 (automatic private IP)
- **Broadcast**: All host bits set to 1

üîß **Interactive Tool**: "IP Address Classifier"
- Enter IP addresses
- See class, type (public/private), and purpose
- Practice identifying special addresses

üìù **Exam Tip**: Memorize private IP ranges cold‚Äîthey appear frequently on the exam!

**Step 3: Subnet Masks and CIDR (30 minutes)**

**Subnet Mask Purpose**: Divides IP address into network and host portions.

**Default Masks**:
- Class A: 255.0.0.0 (/8)
- Class B: 255.255.0.0 (/16)
- Class C: 255.255.255.0 (/24)

**CIDR Notation**: `/X` where X = number of network bits

**Examples**:
- `192.168.1.0/24` = 255.255.255.0
- `172.16.0.0/16` = 255.255.0.0
- `10.0.0.0/8` = 255.0.0.0

**Binary Conversion** (Essential Skill):
```
255 = 11111111
254 = 11111110
252 = 11111100
248 = 11111000
240 = 11110000
224 = 11100000
192 = 11000000
128 = 10000000
  0 = 00000000
```

üí° **Key Concept**: Subnet mask determines which portion of IP is network vs. host.

üîß **Practice Tool**: "Binary Converter"
- Convert decimal to binary
- Convert binary to decimal
- Build muscle memory!

**Step 4: Subnetting Fundamentals (40 minutes)**

**Why Subnet?**
- Efficient IP address usage
- Network segmentation
- Security and performance

**Subnetting Process**:

**Example**: Subnet 192.168.1.0/24 into 4 subnets

**Step-by-Step**:
1. **Determine required subnets**: 4 subnets
2. **Calculate bits needed**: 2^2 = 4, so borrow 2 bits
3. **New subnet mask**: /24 + 2 = /26 (255.255.255.192)
4. **Subnet increment**: 256 - 192 = 64

**Resulting Subnets**:
- Subnet 1: 192.168.1.0/26 (hosts: .1-.62, broadcast: .63)
- Subnet 2: 192.168.1.64/26 (hosts: .65-.126, broadcast: .127)
- Subnet 3: 192.168.1.128/26 (hosts: .129-.190, broadcast: .191)
- Subnet 4: 192.168.1.192/26 (hosts: .193-.254, broadcast: .255)

**Subnet Components**:
- **Network Address**: First address (all host bits 0)
- **First Usable**: Network address + 1
- **Last Usable**: Broadcast address - 1
- **Broadcast**: Last address (all host bits 1)
- **Usable Hosts**: 2^(host bits) - 2

üìù **Exam Tip**: Master this formula: Usable hosts = 2^(32 - prefix length) - 2

üîß **Critical Practice**: "Subnet Calculator"
- Practice 20+ subnetting problems
- Try different starting addresses
- Vary subnet requirements
- Time yourself (goal: <2 minutes per problem)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Pitfalls**:
- Forgetting to subtract 2 (network and broadcast) from usable hosts
- Confusing network address with first usable
- Not borrowing enough bits for required subnets
- Arithmetic errors‚Äîpractice!

**Subnetting Shortcut (The Trick)**:
1. Find interesting octet (the one that changes)
2. Calculate increment: 256 - subnet mask value
3. List subnets: 0, increment, increment√ó2, etc.

**Step 5: IPv6 Addressing (15 minutes)**

**Why IPv6?**
- IPv4 exhaustion (4.3 billion addresses insufficient)
- Simplified header
- Built-in security (IPsec)
- No NAT required

**IPv6 Address Structure**:
- 128 bits (16 bytes)
- Hexadecimal notation
- 8 groups of 4 hex digits
- Example: `2001:0DB8:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001`

**Abbreviation Rules**:
1. **Leading zeros**: Can be omitted
   - `2001:0DB8` ‚Üí `2001:DB8`
2. **Consecutive zeros**: Replace with `::`  (once only)
   - `2001:0DB8:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001` ‚Üí `2001:DB8::1`

**IPv6 Address Types**:
- **Unicast**: Single interface
  - Global unicast: `2000::/3` (internet routable)
  - Link-local: `FE80::/10` (local segment only)
  - Unique local: `FC00::/7` (private, like RFC 1918)
- **Multicast**: `FF00::/8`
- **Anycast**: Same as unicast but assigned to multiple interfaces

**Special IPv6 Addresses**:
- **Loopback**: `::1` (equivalent to 127.0.0.1)
- **Unspecified**: `::` (equivalent to 0.0.0.0)

üí° **Key Concept**: IPv6 doesn't use broadcast‚Äîuses multicast instead.

üìù **Exam Tip**: Know how to abbreviate IPv6 addresses and identify address types (link-local starts with FE80).

üîß **Practice**: "IPv6 Address Formatter"
- Abbreviate long IPv6 addresses
- Expand shortened addresses
- Identify address types

**Step 6: Routing Fundamentals (20 minutes)**

**What is Routing?**
Process of forwarding packets between networks based on destination IP address.

**Routing Table**:
Contains:
- **Destination network**: Where packets are going
- **Next hop**: Next router IP
- **Interface**: Exit interface
- **Metric**: Cost (distance, speed, etc.)

**Example Routing Table**:
```
Destination       Next Hop        Interface    Metric
0.0.0.0/0        192.168.1.1     eth0         1      (Default route)
192.168.1.0/24   0.0.0.0         eth0         0      (Directly connected)
10.0.0.0/8       192.168.1.254   eth0         10
```

**Routing Process**:
1. Packet arrives at router
2. Router examines destination IP
3. Looks up best match in routing table
4. Forwards to next hop or directly to destination
5. Decrements TTL (Time To Live)

üí° **Key Concept**: Routers make forwarding decisions based on destination IP, not source IP.

üîß **Interactive Simulation**: "Routing Table Explorer"
- View routing table
- Add/remove routes
- Trace packet path through network
- See routing decisions in real-time

**Step 7: Routing Protocols (15 minutes)**

**Static Routing**:
- **Manually configured** by administrator
- **Pros**: Predictable, secure, low overhead
- **Cons**: Not scalable, no automatic failover
- **Use case**: Small networks, specific routes

**Dynamic Routing**:
- **Automatically learned** via routing protocols
- **Pros**: Scalable, automatic updates, redundancy
- **Cons**: More complex, uses bandwidth/CPU
- **Use case**: Medium to large networks

**Routing Protocol Types**:

**Distance Vector**:
- **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)**
  - Metric: Hop count (max 15)
  - Updates every 30 seconds
  - Slow convergence
  - Rarely used today

- **EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)**
  - Cisco proprietary (was)
  - Metric: Bandwidth, delay, reliability, load
  - Fast convergence
  - Hybrid protocol

**Link State**:
- **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)**
  - Open standard
  - Metric: Cost (based on bandwidth)
  - Fast convergence
  - Scalable (uses areas)
  - Most common IGP

**Path Vector**:
- **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**
  - Exterior gateway protocol (between ISPs/ASes)
  - Metric: Path attributes
  - Internet backbone routing

üìù **Exam Tip**: Know characteristics of RIP, OSPF, and BGP‚Äîthey're frequently tested!

**Step 8: ARP and ICMP (10 minutes)**

**ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**:
- Purpose: Resolve IP address to MAC address
- Process:
  1. Host needs MAC for IP on local network
  2. Sends ARP request (broadcast)
  3. Target responds with ARP reply (unicast)
  4. Requester caches MAC in ARP table

üí° **Key Concept**: ARP is necessary because Layer 2 (Ethernet) uses MAC addresses, but Layer 3 (IP) uses IP addresses.

**ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**:
- Diagnostic and error reporting
- Used by `ping` and `traceroute`
- Common message types:
  - **Echo Request/Reply** (ping)
  - **Destination Unreachable**
  - **Time Exceeded** (TTL = 0, used by traceroute)
  - **Redirect** (better route exists)

üîß **Hands-On**: "ARP Table Viewer"‚Äîwatch ARP cache populate as devices communicate.

**Step 9: Knowledge Check Quiz (15 minutes)**

‚úÖ **Knowledge Check Questions**:
1. What are the private IP ranges?
2. Subnet 192.168.10.0/24 into 8 subnets‚Äîwhat's the new mask?
3. How many usable hosts in a /26 network?
4. What is the purpose of a default route (0.0.0.0/0)?
5. Differentiate RIP, OSPF, and BGP.
6. What does ARP do?
7. Abbreviate: 2001:0DB8:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001
8. What is a link-local IPv6 address range?

**Step 10: Intensive Labs (60 minutes)**

**Lab 1: Subnetting Challenge** (30 minutes)
Complete 15 subnetting problems:
- Various network sizes
- Different requirements (subnets, hosts)
- VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masks)
- Goal: 90%+ accuracy

**Lab 2: Routing Configuration** (20 minutes)
- Configure static routes on virtual routers
- Set up default route
- Verify connectivity with ping
- Troubleshoot routing issues

**Lab 3: IP Address Planning** (10 minutes)
Scenario: Design IP addressing scheme for small business
- 3 departments with different host requirements
- Use private addressing
- Document network, usable range, broadcast for each subnet

üåê **Real-World Application**:
Network Layer expertise is essential for:
- IP address planning and management
- Network design and architecture
- Routing protocol configuration
