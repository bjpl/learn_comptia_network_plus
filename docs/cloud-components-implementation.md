## Educational Alignment

Both components directly address CompTIA Network+ Learning Objective 1.2:
- Deployment models (Public, Private, Hybrid)
- Service models (SaaS, IaaS, PaaS)
- Connectivity options (VPN, Direct Connect)
- Cloud gateways (Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway)
- NFV (Network Function Virtualization)
- VPC configuration (subnets, security groups)
- Scalability and elasticity
- Multitenancy

## Usage Examples

### CloudSummaryBuilder
```tsx
import { CloudSummaryBuilder } from './components/cloud';

function App() {
  return <CloudSummaryBuilder />;
}
```

### CloudArchitectureDesigner
```tsx
import { CloudArchitectureDesigner } from './components/cloud';

function App() {
  return <CloudArchitectureDesigner />;
}
```

## File Structure
```
src/components/cloud/
├── cloud-types.ts                     # TypeScript type definitions
├── cloud-data.ts                      # Scenarios, component library, validation
├── CloudSummaryBuilder.tsx            # Component 7

└── index.ts                           # Barrel exports
```

## Next Steps

To integrate these components into the main application:
1. Import components from `src/components/cloud`
2. Add to navigation/routing
3. Include in main component registry
4. Add to progress tracking system
5. Link to Learning Objective 1.2 in dashboard

## Testing Recommendations

### CloudSummaryBuilder
- Test all 5 scenarios
- Verify scoring accuracy
- Check word counter thresholds
- Validate form completeness checks
- Test ideal solution display

### CloudArchitectureDesigner
- Test drag-and-drop for all 18 components
- Verify connection creation/deletion
- Check validation rules
- Test property configuration
- Verify export functionality

## Performance Considerations

- Efficient re-rendering with React hooks
- Canvas optimization with SVG for connections
- Grid snap calculations
- Real-time word counting (debounced if needed)
- Validation runs on-demand (not continuous)

## Accessibility Features

- Semantic HTML structure
- Keyboard navigation support
- Color-coded feedback (with text labels)
- Clear error messages
- Form labels and descriptions
